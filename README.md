# TutorReview

TutorReview creates Python dictionaries from two .xlsx files containing student reviews collected during my time as a Python tutor for CougarCS at the University of Houston. The program then outputs the average rating I received during the fall 2021 and spring 2022 semesters:

```
Out of 48 student reviews, I have a rating of 4.82 out of 5.
```

To protect student privacy, I removed all student last names, changed Discord usernames, and removed any PSIDs.
